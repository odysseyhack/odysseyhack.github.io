## Overall Code Quality score
This weekend Better Code Hub was part of the worlds biggest BlockChain and AI Hackathon in the world: [Odyssey.org](https://odyssey.org).

A whooping number of 7391 analyses where done for 140 repos over the weekend. 
Almost 35% of the repos scored a 10/10 on the final day. 
Well done! 

One of the participants said  "Great that you challenge us on improving code quality, even at a hackathon you can create technical dept"
