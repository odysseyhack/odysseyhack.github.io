## Overall Code Quality score
This weekend Better Code Hub was part of the worlds biggest BlockChain and AI Hackathon in the world: [Odyssey.org](https://odyssey.org). Writing maintainable code was an integral part of the jury process. It might seem strange but even at a Hackathon code quality matters! One particpant said "Even at a Hackathin you can create technical dept". 

The 100 teams were invited to work in GitHub teams and created 140 (private) repos. Code quality was analysed for every commit in every repo starting at day 1 of the hackathon. A whooping number of 7391 analyses where done.

Almost 25% of the repos scored a 10/10 on the final day. Well done! 

## 10/10? Get Grilled
The teams who scored a 10/10 were invited for a technical interview with consultants of the Software Improvement Group. In these 'Grill' sessions we challenged the solutions on topics like architecture, deployment choices and security concerns. We were impressed by the technical quality of the tech leads in the grill sessions




One of the participants said  "Great that you challenge us on improving code quality, even at a hackathon you can create technical dept"
