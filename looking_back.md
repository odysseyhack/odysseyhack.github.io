## Overall Code Quality score
This weekend Better Code Hub was part of the worlds biggest BlockChain and AI Hackathon in the world: [Odyssey.org](https://odyssey.org). Writing maintainable code was an integral part of the jury process. It might seem strange but even at a Hackathon [code quality matters](/code-quality-matters.md)! One particpant said "Even at a Hackathon you can create technical dept". 

The 100 teams were invited to work in GitHub teams and created 140 (private) repos. Code quality was analysed for every commit in every repo starting at day 1 of the hackathon. A whooping number of 7391Â analyses where done over the weekend.

Almost 25% of the repos scored a 10/10 on the final day. Well done! For a list of all the individual scores please visit this [scoreboard](/scoreboard.md)

## 10/10? Get Grilled and a Golden Balloon
The teams that scored a 10/10 were invited for a technical interview with consultants of the [Software Improvement Group](https:/sig.eu). In these 'Grill' sessions the techleads were challenged on software engineering topics like why Blockchain?, how scalable is the architecture and how well security concerns. Overall we were impressed by the technical quality of the tech leads in the grill sessions. It was great to be part of the vibe.
