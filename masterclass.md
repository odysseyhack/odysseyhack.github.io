## Preparing for the judges: How mature is my prototype

Software Improvement Group (SIG) supports teams to write future-proof code. During the Odyssey Hackathon teams will have free access to code quality check tool BetterCodeHub. This tool automatically checks your Github code for 10 out of 10 compliancy. SIG consultants will assess the maturity of your prototype by interviewing or â€˜grilling' your techlead. Passing the interview (Golden Balloon) will help you demonstrate the maturity of your prototype to the judges.

During the workshop Luc Brandts and Michiel Cuijpers of Software Improvement Group will explain the concept of code quality and why code quality is important for investors. They will present you the 10 guidelines for building maintainable software. How these guidelines will be checked during the hackathon. With your own GitHub account you will run your first BetterCodeHub.com analysis within minutes.
