## Tech Lead Briefing at the Hackathon - Friday 12 April 11.00-11.30 on the process

On this [page you can read](https://odysseyhack.github.io/the-evaluation) exactly how this process works. Your tech lead is invited to this pre-hackathon briefing, where we run through the process and answer any questions.

## Tutorial: How to get started with BetterCodehub
- We have prepared a short [Tutorial](https://odysseyhack.github.io/tutorial)

## How to get a [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) score to qualify for the grilling session?
- The more guidelines you get right, the higher the final score.
- if you have multiple repos the lowest scoring repo is your final mark (weakest link principle).
- On Sunday April 14th between 10:30 and 11:59 ask for a sticker with your final score.

## How to get a ‘Mature Prototype’ Star?
- If your main repo scores a Better Code Hub 10/10 you qualify to schedule a grilling session.
- Schedule the 10 minute slot for your session at the Jedi Hangout (limited slots available, so be quick!)
- Get Grilled in this interview (slots available Saturday 20.00-22.00 and Sunday 9.00-12.00)
