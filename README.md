# Free service to evaluate the maturity of your prototype

During the Odyssey Hackathon Software Improvement Group (SIG) Code JEDI will support the teams to write future-proof code by means of tooling and advice. In short: The Code JEDI will assess the maturity of your prototype.

When: 12 - 14 April 2019

Where:  The former Sugar Factory, Groningen NL

How: [github.com/odysseyhack](https://github.com/odysseyhack) & [BetterCodeHub.com](https:BetterCodeHub.com)

Powered by: [Github](https://Github.com) and [SoftwareImprovementGroup](https://SoftwareImprovementGroup.com)


## How does this work?

Teams will be invited to a GitHub team repo where they can push their code continuously. The repo can be a private or public (or remote git) repo. For every push BetterCodeHub will automatically check the code quality. Installation of BCH is zero-setup. The code quality score is displayed on a 10 point scale. All teams will receive a sticker with the final maintainability score for their canvas on Sunday. 

The teams that score a 10/10 qualify for a short interview by a SIG Code JEDI. During this 10 minute session the JEDI will ‘grill’ your teach lead on the software engineering choices made: choice of technology, code architecture, security concerns and blockchain implementation. On passing the ‘grill’ session a Golden Balloon is awarded, this will help you demonstrate the maturity of your prototype to the judges.



## What 10 guidelines?

1. Your code will be evaluated against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) (Ask for a free copy at the masterclass on [April 11th](https://Odysseyhack.github.io/masterclass))

2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png).

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub CI and can run at Pull Requests and Pushes.

4. 17 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum codebase size 200 KLoc.

## How to contact us
- At the Hackathon please use Odyssey community bettercodehub_support 

## How to get started

1. All the teams were created on forehand and email invites were send. Please check these invite emails from GitHub.

- Your team will be added in this [Odysseyhack Organization](https://github.com/odysseyhack)
- You will be a maintainer of your team, so you can add more people.
- You will be able to create private repos and add please these to the team.
- Your repo can be a 'Git Remote'

2. Add your repo to your team in the [Odysseyhack Organization](https://github.com/odysseyhack)

- You first need to add/create the repository within the blockchaingers org (using the + next to your profile icon) 
- then go to your team -> repositories -> add -> and add the created respository

3. Go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and accept the scopes. 

4. Press play and get instant feedback on the guidelines and pick refactor candidates.

5. Click on the Pull request icon to make Better Code Hub analyse every Push and Pull Request.


## How to get support

1. Before the event, through [email](mailto:bettercodehub@sig.eu).

2. During the event by talking to Better Code Hub jedi with questions about refactoring tactics and code implementation. use slack-channel: bettercodehub_support

3. After the event, through [email](mailto:bettercodehub@sig.eu).

## How to exclude your configuration / library files from analysis

1. Get your current configuration file from your project settings. (Gear icon on bettercodehub.com)

2. PLace that config in _.bettercodehub.yml_ in your repository root

3. Add a section called exclude, in there add the files/folders you want to exclude. Supported exclusion options can be found [at the bettercodehub documentation](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual)


## How to get a sticker with my score 

1. The more guidelines you get right, the more points you get.

2. if you have multiple repos the lowest scoring repo is your final mark (weakest link principle).

3. On Sunday April 14th between 10:30 and 11:59 ask for a sticker with your final score.

5. Put the sticker on the canvas.

## How to get Grilled

2. pick your 10 minute slot for your session

3. get Grilled

4. if you pass you get a Golden Balloon
