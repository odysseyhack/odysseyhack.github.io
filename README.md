# Code Quality Matters during your Odyssey!

When: 12 - 14 April 2019

Where:  The former Sugar Factory, Groningen NL

Website: [Odyssey.org](https://Odyssey.org)



## How your code is evaluated

1. Your code will be evaluated against 10 guidelines for building future-proof code. The guidelines are described in full in [“Building Maintainable Software”](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) (Ask for a free copy at the masterclass on [April 11th](https://Odysseyhack.github.io/masterclass))

2. Find a concise reference card of the guidelines [here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*TS-ZTeI7sQS7dy_AlMqSXQ.png).

3. You can check your code against the guidelines using Better Code Hub, a GitHub integration provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu). Better Code Hub integrates with the GitHub CI and can run at Pull Requests and Pushes.

4. 17 modern programming languages are [supported](https://bettercodehub.com/docs/configuration-manual) with a maximum codebase size 200 KLoc.

## How to contact us

- then go to your team -> repositories -> add -> and add the created respository

3. Go to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and accept the scopes. 

4. Press play and get instant feedback on the guidelines and pick refactor candidates.

5. Click on the Pull request icon to make Better Code Hub analyse every Push and Pull Request.


## How to get support

1. Before the event, through [email](mailto:bettercodehub@sig.eu).

2. During the event by talking to Better Code Hub jedi with questions about refactoring tactics and code implementation. use slack-channel: bettercodehub_support

## How to exclude your configuration / library files from analysis

1. Get your current configuration file from your project settings. (Gear icon on bettercodehub.com)

## How to get points for technical quality?
